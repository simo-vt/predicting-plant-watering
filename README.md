# predicting-plant-watering

Using Machine Learning to predict plant watering.

The current work is the final project for the CM3070 module of the BSc Computer Science (Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence) programme by University of London.

## Components

### Readings with ESP8266

This is the first step of the project. The directory `readings_esp8266` contains the Arduino IDE code running on the ESP8266 microcontroller.

### Data Collection with Raspberry Pi

Data is regularly collected by a Raspberry Pi running a continuous Python process shown in the `data_collection_pi` directory.

### Machine Learning

Finally, the collected data is passed to the project inside the `machine_learning` directory.
